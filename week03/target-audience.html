                        Spencer lives on his family farm with his wonderful wife and three kids. He raises cattle, and harvests alfalfa. He's 33, has grown up and lived in Hamer most of his life, and learned how to work hard from his father. Spencer loves farming and really enjoys the community he's in. He recently inherited some grazing pasture from his father, but doesn't have enough cattle to graze it all. He also needs to buy some hay to feed his cattle, as he is starting to plant a new crop this year. So, Spencer has a few business ventures he would like to take.
