                <h1>Help I Live In Rexburg</h1>
                <p>This website is made to help you find things to do in a small town with nothing to do. In this case, I live in Rexburg, Idaho. Rexburg, Idaho is a college town, home to Brigham Young University - Idaho. Many college students come here for an amazing educational opportunity, but they run into one problem. There's nothing to do here. <br><br> Yes, Rexburg, Idaho is a very small town with very little to do. It seems that many people don't like living here and plan on moving out as soon as possible. However, for most people, it is a while before that time comes. In the mean time, I've created this website to give you all the things you can do in Rexburg while you're stuck here. <br><br> Need fun activities to do in your free time? We have all the best activities easily available to the Rexburg area, both paid and free. <br><br> Need a fun date idea? We'll test out the most creative first dates ideas to see how well they work for fun and getting to know someone. <br><br> Want to get involved in community events? We'll post updates on all the major community events coming up so you can have fun while also taking part in the Rexburg community. <br><br> Just want to get out of the house and live your life to the fullest?
