            <h4 class="website">Astrology Club</h4>
            <a class="link" href="https://astrologyclub.byspotify.com/" target="_blank">astrologyclub.byspotify.com</a>
            <img class="screenshot" src="img/astro.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Astrology Club's website on Mobile view">
            <p class="desc">This website shows great hierarchy by making sure the most important part is the biggest. The title 'Astrology Club' introduces you to the website itself. Then, your eyes are drawn to the 'Take the Quiz' button, as it stands out from the background. Next, you read the senetence above it, helping you understand what this webiste does.</p>

        <div class="principle" id="prin2">
            <h3 class="name">Contrast</h3>
            <h4 class="website">irl/URL</h4>
            <a class="link" href="https://irl-url.com/" target="_blank">irl-url.com</a>
            <img class="screenshot" src="img/irl.jpg" alt="Screenshot of irl-URL's website on Mobile view">
            <p class="desc">This website is a great example of contrast. Although the background of the webiste is several different moving shapes, colors, and themes, they made sure the text is easily readable. They deliberatly chose the right colors for the text, the right fonts to make it readable, and the right spacing.</p>

        <div class="principle" id="prin3">
            <h3 class="name">Rule of Thirds</h3>
            <h4 class="website">Hape</h4>
            <a class="link" href="https://www.hape.io/" target="_blank">hape.io</a>
            <img class="screenshot" src="img/hape.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Hape's website on Mobile view">
            <p class="desc">This website is very fun to just look at. The front page is a 3D model of an NFT monkey walking, and as you scroll you zoom out and around him, showing really interesting perspcetives of what the website sells: NFTs. They showcase their product in good design, using the rule of thirds.</p>
